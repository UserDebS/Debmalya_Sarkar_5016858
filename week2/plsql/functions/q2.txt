--Question: Write a function CalculateMonthlyInstallment that takes the loan amount, interest rate, and loan duration in years as input and returns the monthly installment amount.

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION CALCULATEMONTHLYINSTALLMENT (
    LOANAMOUNT NUMBER,
    INTERESTRATE NUMBER,

    -- Calculate the monthly installment using the formula for an annuity
    IF MONTHLYRATE = 0 THEN
        MONTHLYINSTALLMENT := LOANAMOUNT / TOTALPAYMENTS;
