--Question: Write a PL/SQL block that loops through all customers, checks their age, and if they are above 60, apply a 1% discount to their current loan interest rates.
begin
    for customer in (select customerid as id, floor(months_between(sysdate, dob) / 12) as age from customers) loop
    if customer.age >= 60 then
    	update loans
    	set interestrate = interestrate - 1
    	where customerid = customer.id;
    end if;
	end loop;
end;
